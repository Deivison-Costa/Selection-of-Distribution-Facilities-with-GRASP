# Selection-of-Distribution-Facilities-with-GRASP
This is a project that demonstrates how to use the GRASP (Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure) algorithm to solve the problem of selecting cities to build distribution facilities with the aim of minimizing transportation costs. The project is implemented in C++.
